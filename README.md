# Socket-File-Server

A multi-threaded server capable of sending and receiving files over a TCP connection with Java sockets.

Implements a custom API for server requests and a custom recursive file structure for the transport of database layout.


To use:
1) Edit the directory in Server and Client to local directories that can act as the servers and clients home directories.
2) Run the Runner class and the ClientGUI (they are both threaded so you can run locally for testing).
